SEM6120 - Introduction to Intelligent Systems - Assignment 1
============================================================

Your task for this assessment is to choose one subject from the list below, write a 3000-word report on some of the latest research from this area, and give a presentation on the subject that should last 10 minutes. The report and presentation count for 40% of the overall mark for this module, with the report contributing 20% and the presentation 20%.

The report (20% of the overall mark for this module) should analyse at least 3 research papers on the topic you choose. The report should provide an introduction to the subject area (4%), describe the research undertaken in the papers (8%) and finally critique and evaluate the research (8%). You should use a bibliography and reference the papers appropriately in the main text. You will probably find it very helpful to read around the subject, particularly when writing the introduction to the subject area. 

The report should be submitted via Blackboard before 5pm on Friday 25th October, and should be in PDF format. The report will be assessed in line with the assessment criteria for essays given in the student handbook. Your attention is drawn to the plagiarism warning given in the Student Handbook.

The presentation (20% of the overall mark for this module) will take place on Friday 18th October 9:30am-11am. This is to give you some feedback that can then be integrated into your final report that is submitted a week later. The audience (who will all be taking part in the marking) will be the other students plus myself. You will be assessed not only on the content of the talk (depth of knowledge and understanding shown, etc), but also on general presentation skills. The marking scheme is available [here](pres-marksheet.pdf).
