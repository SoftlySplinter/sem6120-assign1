## Genetic Algorithms

### What is a genetic algorithm?

* [Example](http://boxcar2d.com/)
* More formally:
  * A form of evolutionary algorithm.
  * Focus on search optimisation.
  * Biologically inspired.

### How does a genetic algorithm work?

At a glance:

* Solutions are represented as **chromosomes**.
* An initial population of chromosomes is produced.
* Each chromosome is ranked.
* The best chromosomes are picked and carried on to the next **generation**.
* Evolution of new chromosomes.
* Repeat until finished.

### Natural Selection

* Select the best suited individuals from a population.
* Based on a fitness function applied to chromosomes.
* Select the best individuals based on this fitness function.

### Selection

* One of the key parts of a GA.
* To generate good offspring a method of selecting good parents is required.
* Three
